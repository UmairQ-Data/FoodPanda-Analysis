# FoodPanda Data Analysis

## Project Overview  
- Analyzed customer order and delivery data from FoodPanda using Python and visualization tools.  
- Goal: Identify key business insights and recommend improvements to increase customer satisfaction and retention.

## Key Insights

- A few restaurants show consistently high cancellation rates â€” affecting customer trust.  
- Loyalty programs have strong potential to boost repeat orders and long-term retention.

## Recommendations

- Partner more closely with high-rated restaurants and monitor cancellation trends.  
- Implement a loyalty program targeting repeat customers to increase retention.  

## Future Scope  
- Extend analysis to include customer reviews sentiment and churn prediction.  
- Segment orders by geography or cuisine to tailor marketing efforts.  
- Automate reporting workflow (e.g. periodic dashboards or emails).
